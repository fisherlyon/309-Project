# CSC 309 Project -- MATH MADNESS

## Description
Our overall goal is to develop a math tutor, but with a twist. We are planning to have two panels. The left panel will be a visual in which there is some kind of duel going on between your character and your opponent's character. The right panel will be interactive and the goal is to solve various math problems using drag and drop on different numbers. Our motivation is to provide a math tutor for the youth. Our core idea is to make learning fun by combining a mathematical learning experience with a cool pvp visual aspect. <br>
